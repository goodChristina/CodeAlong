Hi, my name is Christina, but you can call me <span style="color: teal;">Cris</span>. This is my repo for practicing different concepts in **Java**.

## $${\color{orange}Purpose}$$

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Java (not be confused with Javascript)
- Try new concepts
- Get used to the quirks of Github

## $${\color{orange}Contents}$$

You might see:

- Variables and data types  
- Loops, conditionals
- Methods and classes  
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts  
- Data structures  
- Excellent exception handling  
- Games

## $${\color{orange}Usage}$$

Feel free to:
- Browse the code
- Laugh

## $${\color{orange}Notes}$$

This isn't for reproduction. Just a place to practice.
